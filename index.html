									<h2 id="content">6+ months as a Data Scientist (Apprentice) at the DS Community</h2>
									<p> At the DS Community, I acquired valuable skills in data analysis with Python, 
										using the main libraries employed in data science, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Numpy. 
										Additionally, I developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and 
										Streamlit Cloud to visualize business metrics for a company.
									</p>
									
										<h2 id="content">1+ year as a Master's student in Natural Sciences (UENF)</h2>
										<p>Analysis and modeling of river flow data. Initially, I conducted an analysis of the reference 
											flows Q90 and Q90 in São Fidélis - RJ as part of the initial stage of the research. 
											For this year, as part of the dissertation proposal, I plan to apply indices to identify hydrological 
											extremes in the Paraíba do Sul Basin and make predictions of monthly flows at different river gauging stations in the basin.</p>
										
										<h2 id="content">6 months as Extension Fellow: Environmental data analysis with R</h2>
										<p>Improvement and application of courses dedicated to the R programming language, with an emphasis on environmental data analysis.
											Main activities include conducting introductory modules on the R language in remote format, 
											as well as contributions to the creation of specialized courses in data manipulation and visualization.</p>

											<h3>Development of a Business Management Dashboard with Streamlit.</h3>
											<p>In this project, concepts of Python programming, data manipulation, strategic thinking, and business logic, 
												along with web development tools like Streamlit and Github, 
												were used to develop a management dashboard with the key metrics of a restaurant marketplace company </p>
											<p> The final result of the project was a dashboard hosted on a Cloud environment and made available through a web link. 
												The dashboard can be accessed by any device connected to the internet.</p>
												<h4>The tools used were:</h4>
															<ul>
																<li>Python.</li>
																<li>Jupyter Lab.</li>
																<li>VS Code.</li>
																<li>Terminal.</li>
																<li>Streamlit and Streamlit Cloud.</li>
